In this mini-projkect, I worked with Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, and RESTful API's. I was able to build Kafka Producers and Consumers and was able to use a topic to exchange messages, with an added REST API route to post messages and recieve within the Kafka environment. 

Includes:
- Spring for Apache Kafka Template
- Kafka Producer Config
- Kafka Consumer Config
- Kafka Listener
- A Topic
- RESTful API Integration
